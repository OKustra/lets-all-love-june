I still feel connected—and it’s thanks to you that I’ve met so many of my friends. You’ve built something genuinely special, and I never take that for granted.\n\nYou’re a hell of a spirit. The way you put energy into helping others connect, create, and thrive—it speaks to a determined and kind soul. That kind of care and effort never goes unnoticed, not by me, not by anyone.\n\nNow, back to the main event: it’s your birthday! A lot of people focus on celebrating the day itself, but I like to reflect on all it’s taken to get here. Everything you’ve been through, everything you’ve done—it’s all led to this moment, and that’s something worth honouring.\n\nWe’re all proud of you for making it to this point. No one else could’ve lived your story the way you have. Only you could be you in this wild, beautiful drama called life—and I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nHappy Birthday, June. 💛",

I probably could have just sent you a collage or something similar but I want to believe the visual representation of seeing where your friends are, and the colors they represent, have a meaning beyond that which could be conveyed with a slideshow.\n\nI hope this idea is conveyed to you in the way I originally envisioned. And I hope that my effort and love, along with the love of everyone who contributed, is reflected here. Even though I would have liked to do a lot more with this web page lol. There was even more in each response that I wish I could have fully included in this project. I have been provided with half-decade old videos from iCloud, funny memes, recipes, book recommendations, and more that people want to share with you. I can't wait to show you all of it.\n\nYou are the most incredible person I have ever met. I am grateful every day for the ways you support me. You have the kind of magnetic personality that draws people to you. And I am grateful for all the wonderful connections and rich friendships you have helped me to foster. I want you to know that we are not alone in Vegas. Love is truly all around you, and I want you to see the way our friends and I see you.\n\nHappy Birthday, June.
