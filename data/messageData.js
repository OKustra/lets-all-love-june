I still feel connected‚Äîand it‚Äôs thanks to you that I‚Äôve met so many of my friends. You‚Äôve built something genuinely special, and I never take that for granted.\n\nYou‚Äôre a hell of a spirit. The way you put energy into helping others connect, create, and thrive‚Äîit speaks to a determined and kind soul. That kind of care and effort never goes unnoticed, not by me, not by anyone.\n\nNow, back to the main event: it‚Äôs your birthday! A lot of people focus on celebrating the day itself, but I like to reflect on all it‚Äôs taken to get here. Everything you‚Äôve been through, everything you‚Äôve done‚Äîit‚Äôs all led to this moment, and that‚Äôs something worth honouring.\n\nWe‚Äôre all proud of you for making it to this point. No one else could‚Äôve lived your story the way you have. Only you could be you in this wild, beautiful drama called life‚Äîand I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nHappy Birthday, June. üíõ",
